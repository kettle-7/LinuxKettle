I used to be Kettle3D on GitHub, but I decided to do a little re-branding because I no longer feel like being centred on a game that I haven't played this year, and the installer doesn't really work. So I thought, I'll try something else.

Kettle3D was great for me when I was just starting to program, and I was using Windows and gaming more than programming in my free time. Now, I use Linux, play around with GTK among other things, and prefer my own programs to be open source. (Spoiler: Kettle3D was not.)

I'm using Fedora (just installed yesterday!), and in about a month I'll probably switch to a different distro (I haven't settled on one yet since I first started using Linux in June), and I have started a blog at [linuxkettle.github.io](https://linuxkettle.github.io/) about tinkering with programming on Linux.

I'm currently looking for ideas of what to make, I have a couple to choose from. I'm mostly sticking to GTK and Vala (I've only been using both since February this year), and I'm liking it so far.

You can find more about what I'm doing at [linuxkettle.github.io](https://linuxkettle.github.io/).
