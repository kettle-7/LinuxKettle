Although this program has not yet sworn at me, I can't guarantee that
it'll treat you the same. So, basically what I'm saying is, this
program may contain explicit language. There you have it. I disclaim
all responsibility on the output from a random word generator.

Note: Despite my best efforts (not really) this program might not compile.
It is tested and proven to work on Fedora 33 Workstation 64-bit, and should
work on other 64-bit *nix operating systems. It almost certainly won't work
on ARM Linux or 32-bit Linux or any of those without a few tweaks to the
Makefile. Also, the program depends on the gtk3-devel package for various
headers and libraries.

On 64-bit Linux, the build process is relatively simple. Extract this
tarball if you haven't already, and open a terminal in the folder. Then you
run these commands:

    make
    ./randomwords

./randomwords is an executable generated by the make process.

The source code in this tarball is slightly modified output from the Vala
compiler (I didn't write all of this C stuff by myself :), so it's a bit
of a mess. I'm sorry about that.
